# Sound Study Volume 1
This is the first volume in our open source sample library series, Sound Study.
We have work from a number of our students in this initial installment. There are some really fantastic samples in here.

This series was inspired by the Music Thing Radio Music by Tom Whitwell, so our first installment is formatted in both Radio Music-friendly format as well as high quality Wav format. The samples are arranged into separate folders for both formats.

Five students and myself took part in this first volume. You will find 6 folders in the Radio Music folder. They organized by artist.

"Recorded a bunch of knob twiddling in the modular then ran it through a Simpler with the Push and a ton of wacky effects"

"I used a mixture of one shots from my modular and recordings from my field recorder. I recorded the samples straight into Ableton and then sent each channel through my analog Neve Shelford channel strips to give some shine."

-DiPrima

"OSC MN DPO, SEQ Intellijel Metropolis"
